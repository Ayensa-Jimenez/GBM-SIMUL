# GBM-SIMUL
Basic computational framework for recreating glioblastoma progression in one dimension within microfluidic devices

This repository contains the main scripts for the reproduction of the results presented in the paper [Ayensa-Jimenez et al. (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78215-3).

## Description

The repository includes the following folders and files:

- `data`: This folder contains the experimental data:
    - `core.mat`: Pre-processing scripts.
    - `palisade.mat`: Scripts for the evaluation of new images.
    - `double_palisade.mat`: Post-processing scripts.
- `main.m`: Main script reproducing the simulation for the three experiments: necrotic core, pseudopalisade and double pseudopalisade.
- `simulationGBM.m`: Function for GBM progression simulation.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine (you can use: `git clone https://github.com/Ayensa-Jimenez/GBM-SIMUL.git`).
2. Make sure you have Matlab R2020 or later installed.
3. Open Matlab and run the scripts-

## Usage 

### Reproducing the paper results
1. Run the script `main.m`

### Run the model with different model parameters
1. Modify the value of the parameters at the `main.m` script.
2. Run the `main.m` script.
